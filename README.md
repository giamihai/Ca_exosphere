# Ca_exosphere
Numerical data based on MC model  

This directory contains the numerical data obtained from MC simulations of the generation of Mercury's CaO and Ca exosphere due to the surface bombardement by comet Encke's micromoteoroids. 

The inputs of the model (boundary conditions) are included in the .inf files whereas their detailed description is presented in our paper. 

Note that files 

Ca_en_p20161018-12.45.42.inf and 
Ca_en_p20161018-12.45.42.inf.txt 

include all information and numerical data corresponding to the energetic Ca component of the exosphere (see paper for details)


Files

CaO_Ca_th_p20161017-18.17.59.inf and 
CaO_Ca_th_p20161017-18.17.59.txt 

include all information and numerical data corresponding to the thermal CaO and Ca components of the exosphere (see paper for details).
